**Installation**

Create a folder inside `addons` called anything you want (preferably something like 'swvr').

Place the contents of the `lua`, `materials`, `models`, and `sounds` folders inside.

**Generating Documentation**

Generating documentation assumes you have `ldoc` as well as `lua-discount` installed.

Please install them using a tool like *luarocks* before continuing.

Run `ldoc .` inside the root directory to generate documentation into the `docs` folder.

The `doc.md` file inside of the documentation folder can bbe customized beforehand to change the manual.
